# nah-he-tweakin
This is an instagram comment bot. It will most likely break within the week, none of the code uses good practice but it works. Thats all that matters am I right?
The while loop was never finished in the tweakin program, betsy however does work but she only sends one comment without repeating it... which of course can be easily modified so deal with it.
