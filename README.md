This is an instagram comment bot. It will most likely break within the week, none of the code uses good practice but it works. Thats all that matters am I right?
The while loop was never finished in the tweakin program, betsy however does work but she only sends one comment without repeating it... which of course can be easily modified so deal with it.

Betsy is your best bet to play around with, it logs in and comments once before closing the browser.

Tweakin is a messy nightmare... use at your own risk.

Spamit is your go to spam bot! It will comment and comment and comment with out any sign of stopping for hours on end! 

Note: When putting in the xpaths for finding the comment section there was an extra div on my instagram so it will most likely not work on yours unless you have a brand new account. All you have to do is change the [3] to a [2] in all three of the xptaths below the üç©. Good luck!
